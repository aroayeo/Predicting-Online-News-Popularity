# Module 4 Project - Online News Popularity

Authors - Aroa Gomez, Mohammed Hannan

Dataset:
 - Approximately 40,000 articles.
 - Articles parsed and key variables recorded.
 - Length of title, length of article, day published etc.
 - Target variable: Number of times an article will be shared.
 
Files:
 - Jupyter notebook.
 - Dataset CSV file.
 - Python files containing refactored code.
 - Presentation slides.

Objective:
    We want to create a regression model that predicts the number of times an article will be shared based on the content. The data has been cleaned by UCI, and key features of the article have been recorded in a csv file. We will explore the relationship between variables such as: length of the title, length of the article, day published, number of links in article and others.

Client:
    Our client is a publication company trying to increase the popularity of their articles. They would like to know what features an article should have to maximise its popularity.
